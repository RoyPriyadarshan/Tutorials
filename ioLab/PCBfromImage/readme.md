# Creating a PCB from an Image

Sometimes, you just want to get to making a PCB without having to go to all the trouble of actually *designing* it.  Sometimes you stumble across a sweet electronics project, but instead of editable design files, there is only a black and white image for photo etching.  There are several ways to get around this problem, but one of the fastest for us here in the ioLab is to use [Fab Modules](www.fabmodules.org) to turn the image into toolpaths for the Othermill.

>Fab Modules is a browser-based CAM system, which allows to generate toolpaths for and control lasercutters, CNC-mills and waterjets commonly found in [fablabs](https://www.fablabs.io/).

## Setting up CAM
First, go to the [Fab Modules website](www.fabmodules.org).  When you first arrive, it will be mostly empty, white space.
