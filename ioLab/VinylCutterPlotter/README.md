# Vinyl Cutter/Plotter Quick Guide
![alt text][1]
## About This Process:
- Uses Adobe Illustrator vector files 
- Can draw on and cut vinyl or paper up to card stock thickness.
- Max Dimensions: The max width is 24 inches.  The max length is as long as your material (although difficulty begins to increase around 4-5 feet long.)

## On Plotter:
**1. Load material:**
  - Lift lever on the right side in front below the control panel.
  - Load material from the back.

Adjust gripper wheels to approx 1” (25mm) from edge of material.  Make sure wheels are over a knurled part of the bed roller.
Lower lever to secure the material in place.
Insert utensil (e.g. drag knife, pen, marker, etc.) into carriage and secure with screw.
It is not necessary to crank hard on the screw.  Finger tight will do.  When inserting something other than the drag knife, locate the tip about ⅛” (3mm) above the surface of the paper.

Turn on Plotter (switch is in back right corner).  The carriage will move all the way to the right.
Set start point by moving arrows left and right then press “start point” 
(This will be the bottom right corner on your file in FlexiEXPERT)
If cutting vinyl, do a test cut to make sure the knife cuts all the way through the vinyl, but  does not cut through the back and adjust force accordingly.  When drawing, if pen doesn’t mark you may need to adjust force.  When using a felt tip pen or marker, slower speeds will yield thicker lines because the ink has more time to bleed into the paper.
On iMac:
Download Adobe Illustrator file 
Open FlexiEXPERT and open your AI file
Press ⌘L or File>Cut/Plot  to open plotter dialogue
Adjust media size as necessary.  This is especially important if you want your drawing to be on a specific part of the paper.

Click “Send”


Cleaning up:
Remove your material and pen/drag knife.
Close FlexiEXPERT.
Turn off plotter.


Pro Tips
If you have vectors with different colors in your Illustrator file, these can be treated as different jobs to run.  It is possible, therefore, to make multiple, registered drawings with different color pens.
You can copy your design in the Cut/Plot window if you want to make multiples as a part of the same job.

When drawing, the weight of the line can be manipulated by manipulating the speed.  Slower = bolder line.  Faster = lighter line.  This is especially evident when using felt-tip writing instruments.
In the Cut/Plot window, the start point is automatically set to the bottom right.  To change this you can click your image and drag it, but you can also use the centering commands on the bottom left panel to arrange it to other locations on your medium.

Troubleshooting
My paper is not feeding.
Make sure you have the roller wheels over a knurled section of the roller bar.  If they are on a smooth section, they may slip and your paper will not feed correctly.


The job I started has randomly stopped in the middle. What do I do?
Honestly, the only thing to do is to stop your job, quit the Production Manager in FlexiExpert, and re-set up and restart your job.


The drag knife does not cut all the way through my vinyl.  The pen does not make enough contact with the paper.
Increase the force by turning the Force knob to the right.  The sweet spot for cutting seems to be 3-4.


The drag knife cuts all the way through the vinyl and the backing!  The pen is getting mashed really hard into the paper!
Decrease the force by turning the Force knob to the left.  The sweet spot for cutting seems to be 3-4.
