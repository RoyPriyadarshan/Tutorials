Solar Pulse
===========
In this series of tutorials, we'll build a solar-powered circuit that responds to the amount of sunlight it receives. The circuit will use a solar panel, an RGB (Red/Green/Blue) LED, and a special low-power microcontroller called an ATtiny. We'll learn how to:

* use a low-power, cheap, compact alternative to an Arduino: the ATtiny
* power a microcontroller using a solar panel
* program the microcontroller to respond to changes in voltage
* make any color with an RGB LED.
